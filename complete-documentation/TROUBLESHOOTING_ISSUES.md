## Issue #1: Gmail Authentication Error (EAUTH 535)

### What's Happening
```
Error: EAUTH 535-5.7.8 Username and Password not accepted
Response Code: 535
Command: AUTH PLAIN
```

### Root Cause
Your `.env.local` file has the placeholder value:
```
EMAIL_PASSWORD=your_app_password_here
```

This is NOT your actual Gmail password. You need an **App Password** generated from Google Account.

### Solution: Get Your Gmail App Password

#### Step 1: Enable 2-Step Verification (if not already done)
1. Go to: https://myaccount.google.com/security
2. Under "How you sign in to Google" → Find "2-Step Verification"
3. Click and follow prompts to enable
4. This is REQUIRED to generate App Passwords

#### Step 2: Generate App Password
1. Go to: https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords
   - (This URL only works if 2-Step Verification is enabled)
2. Select:
   - **App**: Mail
   - **Device**: Windows Computer
3. Click "Generate"
4. Google will show a 16-character password like: `xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx`
5. **Copy this password** (don't close the page yet!)

#### Step 3: Remove Spaces from Password
The password Google shows has spaces, but we need to remove them.

**Example:**
- Google shows: `abcd efgh ijkl mnop`
- You should use: `abcdefghijklmnop`

#### Step 4: Update .env.local
1. Open: `c:\Users\anndy\PeaceMatcher\.env.local`
2. Find this line:
   ```
   EMAIL_PASSWORD=your_app_password_here
   ```
3. Replace with your password (no spaces):
   ```
   EMAIL_PASSWORD=abcdefghijklmnop
   ```
4. Save the file

#### Step 5: Restart Dev Server
```bash
# Press Ctrl+C in terminal, then:
npm run dev
```

### Test It
1. Go to: http://localhost:3000/contact
2. Fill the form with test data
3. Submit
4. Should now work without EAUTH error!

### Still Getting Error?
- ❌ Did you enable 2-Step Verification?
- ❌ Did you copy the App Password correctly?
- ❌ Did you remove all spaces from the password?
- ❌ Did you restart the dev server?
- ❌ Check the password doesn't have dashes (- ) instead of spaces

## Issue #2: Page Reloads When Typing in Form

### What's Happening
When you type your name (or any field), the page reloads unexpectedly.

### Root Cause Analysis
The form code is correct and should NOT cause reloads. This could be:

1. **Hot reload in development** - Next.js recompiling
2. **Form submission being triggered** - Unlikely with current code
3. **Missing `e.preventDefault()`** - Not the issue here
4. **Keyboard shortcuts** - Browser/OS triggering reload

### Solution: Prevention Steps

#### Option 1: Check for Browser Extensions
Some browser extensions interfere with forms. Try:
- Open in Incognito mode (disable extensions)
- See if reload still happens
- If it doesn't, disable suspicious extensions

#### Option 2: Ensure preventDefault is Working
The form already has `e.preventDefault()`, but let's verify it's properly attached:

**Current code (correct):**
```tsx
const handleSubmit = async (e: React.FormEvent<HTMLFormElement>) => {
  e.preventDefault();  // ✅ This stops form submission
  setLoading(true);
  // ... rest of code
};

// In form:
<form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
  {/* fields */}
</form>
```

#### Option 3: Check for Keyboard Shortcuts
Windows shortcuts that might cause reload:
- **F5** - Page reload
- **Ctrl+R** - Page reload
- **Ctrl+Shift+R** - Hard reload
- **Enter in form** - Only submits if inside form with submit button

**Solution:** Be careful not to hit these while typing.

#### Option 4: Clear Browser Cache
1. Press **Ctrl+Shift+Delete**
2. Select "All time"
3. Check all boxes
4. Click "Clear data"
5. Refresh page and try again

#### Option 5: Try Different Browser
- Try Chrome, Firefox, or Safari
- See if reload happens in another browser
- This helps identify if it's browser-specific

### Detailed Troubleshooting

#### Check Browser Console for Errors
1. Press **F12** to open Developer Tools
2. Go to **Console** tab
3. Try typing in form
4. Look for red error messages
5. Screenshot/share any errors

#### Check Terminal Logs
When you type, check the terminal where `npm run dev` is running:
- Look for recompilation messages
- Look for error messages
- This tells if form is causing reload or if it's dev server

#### Recreate the Issue
1. Open http://localhost:3000/contact
2. Click in "Full Name" field
3. Type "John"
4. Does page reload?
5. Try each field (Email, Phone, Subject, Message)
6. Does reload happen with specific field?

### Advanced: Add Debug Code (Optional)

If you want to debug, add this to contact/page.tsx:

```tsx
// Add at top of component
useEffect(() => {
  console.log('Contact page mounted');
  
  const handleBeforeUnload = (e: BeforeUnloadEvent) => {
    console.warn('Page about to reload!');
    console.trace('Reload trace');
  };
  
  window.addEventListener('beforeunload', handleBeforeUnload);
  
  return () => {
    window.removeEventListener('beforeunload', handleBeforeUnload);
  };
}, []);
```

This will log when/why page reloads.
