## Quick Start

### To Enable Email Functionality:

1. **Enable 2-Step Verification on Gmail**:
   - Go to: https://myaccount.google.com/security
   - Find "2-Step Verification" section
   - Follow prompts to enable

2. **Generate App Password**:
   - Go to: https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords
   - Select Mail and Windows Computer
   - Google will generate a 16-character password

3. **Update `.env.local`**:
   ```
   EMAIL_USER=shingloo93@gmail.com
   EMAIL_PASSWORD=xxxxxxxxxxxx  (16-char password, no spaces)
   EMAIL_FROM=noreply@PeaceMatcher.com
   EMAIL_TO=shingloo93@gmail.com
   ```

4. **Restart Dev Server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. **Test**:
   - Navigate to http://localhost:3000/contact
   - Fill out the form and submit
   - Check your email inbox for confirmations

## Current Status

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Nodemailer Package | ✅ Installed | Version with TypeScript support |
| API Endpoint | ✅ Created | Full error handling implemented |
| Contact Form UI | ✅ Implemented | Animated with validation |
| Environment Variables | ✅ Configured | Ready for Gmail credentials |
| Documentation | ✅ Complete | Step-by-step setup guide |
| Dev Server | ✅ Running | Ready for testing |

## Next Steps (Optional)

1. **Add App Password to `.env.local`**
   - This activates the email functionality

2. **Test the Contact Form**
   - Submit a test message from the contact page
   - Verify emails are received

3. **Production Setup**
   - Add environment variables to your hosting platform (Vercel, AWS, etc.)
   - Consider using a dedicated email service (SendGrid, Mailgun)
   - Implement rate limiting on the endpoint

## Security Notes

⚠️ **Important:**
- `.env.local` is in `.gitignore` - never commit it to version control
- Use App Passwords (not your main Gmail password)
- Consider rotating credentials periodically
- For production: use environment-specific secrets management
